      <h2>Popular Events and Festivals</h2>
      <p>New Zealand hosts many fun events every year. These are some of the most famous:</p>

      <h3>Waitangi Day</h3>
      <p>Waitangi Day is celebrated on February 6th, marking the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840 between the Māori chiefs and the British Crown. This treaty is considered the founding document of New Zealand. On Waitangi Day, people gather for cultural events, music, performances, and community activities, especially at Waitangi, where the treaty was signed. The day is a reminder of New Zealand's history and the ongoing relationship between Māori and the government.</p>
